# Overview
This is a Space Flyer Game that I worked on to show what I have learned using Python Arcade.
It has a jet plane flying in the sky with clouds going by and missiles that have been launched to 
hit the jet. The jet must avoid the missiles by moving up or down or forward or backward.
Once the jet is hit with a missile the game will end and exit out of the arcade window.

I have learned alot about Python Arcade and how fun it is to use the Arcade library and tools. It 
really makes it easy to set up when most of the inital work has been done and you can just code a game
to do what you would like it to do with the help of arcade.

# Development Environment

I have used Visual Studio code, Python 3.9.0 64-bit on a Mac
I have also installed Python Arcade library, and PyObjC library


# Useful Websites

* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/)
* [So many Google Searches to help me fix issues with my program not running in VS code](Google)

# Future Work

* Make a way for the jet to fire at the missiles and destroy them.
* Save game and level up
* Do a flashing red screen when an enemy is close
